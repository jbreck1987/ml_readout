    "The goal of this notebook is to compare the achieveable energy resoultion of the optimal filter (gen2) with that of the most successful machine learning model, using the same resonator, readout, and noise parameters. The plan is to have the optimal filter template and filter generated in the same way that would be done during a MEC run, using a dataset consisting of pulses of the same height. The machine learning model will have been trained on a variety of pulses within the same range. The largest pulse height used to train the machine learning model will be used to generate the template/filter in the optimal filter code. The results will then be compared on the single pulse height. The process will be repeated, generating the optimal filter template/filter with one pulse but the input phase timestream will have varied pulse heights using the same range that was used when training the model."
